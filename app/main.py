origins = ["*"] #this allows all origins, you can specify the origins you want to allow like ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com", eg https://google.com] will only allow people accessing from google, you can check when you go to google.com and right click and click inspect then go to console and paste 'fetch('http://localhost:8000'/').then(res => res.json()).then(console.log)', you will see hello world, its just so if you are creating an app for specific people, you can limit the domain that accesses it.
